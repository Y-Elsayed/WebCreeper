# WebCreeper: Crawl. Extract. Discover.

**WebCreeper** is an open-source framework designed to build customizable web crawlers. The project focuses on creating a range of "crawler agents," each specialized with unique abilities for specific tasks. Whether it's scraping content, monitoring trends, tracking prices, analyzing sentiment, and more, **WebCreeper** allows you to leverage these agents to perform targeted web crawling with precision.

## The Idea

At the heart of **WebCreeper** is the concept of "crawler agents"â€”specialized crawlers each with a distinct set of capabilities. These agents are modular and designed to carry out specific tasks efficiently. You can mix and match these agents based on your needs, or even create new ones to tackle new challenges as the project evolves.

Each crawler agent is designed to perform its designated task, helping users gather valuable insights from the web in a streamlined, efficient manner.
